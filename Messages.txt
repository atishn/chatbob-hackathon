Hi there! I’m Little Bob!

Mmm… If you are here I think you already knew that.

What’s your name?

Cool Mary. Nice to txt-meet you!

Tell me, how can I help you today?

Nice. We’ll get the perfect sofa for you. 

First let’s get the colors right. Can you send me a photo of the room where you will put your new sofa? I’ll recommend you good color matches for your room.

Looks good! I love clients with good taste 👏 

These are the colors I got:

Does this look right?

Great. Now tell me how your sofa will be used.

For… sitting?

You are right. Silly question. Let me rephrase that. Do you see any of these things happening over your sofa?

Got it! And how many people do you think will be using the sofa, in general?

Ok, almost there. Last question: what are you thinking in terms of budget?

I’ll find a good deal for you 😉

Great! Hold a second, I’m putting my recommendations ready for you.

Suspense….

Ok, here they are! Few sofas that I think it will be perfect for you.


The first one is our Presley Sofa. It’s completely children safe and it matches well with the colors in your room.

The Presley for 3 persons costs  $550.00.

The second one is the Brava Power. Brava is a recliner, super confortable, and the fabric is stain free.

The Brava for your family size is $700.00. A bit above your budget, but it’s a very good sofa.

Finally, here’s the Alex Sofa. This is a best-seller at Bob’s. It’s beautiful, it’s easy to remove fur and it’s staing resistant.

The Alex sofa I’d suggest for your room costs $600.00.

I think Alex is one of my favorite collections from the store. I actually have one in my living room.

Just kidding, I’m not a real person, I don’t have a house. But I do love the  Alex collection.

But tell, which ones you liked? 

Excellent choices! Are you choosing this sofa alone or do you have more people choosing with you? Like family, or housemates?

I can help you talking talking to them. You know I’m funny 😝It can make the choosing process a little but easier.
